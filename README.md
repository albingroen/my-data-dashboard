## About

The project was inspired by the difficulty to take control over your own data. We believe that being able to have a overview, review and delete your personal data from any software and service you are registered on shouldn't be as difficult as it is today. The method of removing a set of data about yourself on any service today can be as difficult as having to send a actual letter to the company explaining why you want to do this and what data you want to be deleted.

We believe that there needs to be a global way of doing this. You shouldn't have to deep dive into service-specific Q&A's and send emails to support-channels around the entire internet to manage your data. Instead, by using our product you can easily login using Google and gain control over all o your registered services, and manage the data inside of them. Removing your data from Facebook is as easy as a 2-click process. On your personalized dashboard, we give you a overview of how secure your data is and how wide your data is actually spread around the internet. We believe that when people get control and insight about their own data and get access to functionalities like these, together we could prevent numerous data scandals like we the ones we have seen lately.
